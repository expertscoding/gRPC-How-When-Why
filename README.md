# gRPC How, When and Why

In this repo, you can find a basic demo of a gRPC service using netcore 3.1. The project has a server that simulates a windmill farm with data from each windmill. There's also a dashboard to view the data. The main purpose of the code is to demonstrate how host gRPC services and consume them, for single response and streams too, there is a console project for this. Also how easy it's to enable an authentication layer to protect the services.

## Running the project

The best option is to use Visual Studio 2019, any of the available versions can handle this solution. Anyway, you can use VS Code and run every project individually.
